# Classes

A [class](../Classes.md) is basically a template for objects.
It lays out what properties an object is expected to have and
which methods it can perform.

Whether you realized it or not, we've already worked with several
classes in this tutorial, as most all Ferret data types such as
String, Number, List, and Hash are class instance objects.

[`class`](../Keywords.md#class) declarations occur at the document
level and look like this.

    class Person

They are terminated by either [`end`](../Keywords.md#end), another
`class` declaration, or the end of the file.
