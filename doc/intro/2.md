# Scopes and contexts

All Ferret code exists within a private [scope](../Scopes.md).

Execution of a Ferret program begins at the file level. There's
no `main` routine-- you just jump right into the first line of
the running file.

    say("Hello, World!")

By default, variables are accessible only within the scope where
they're defined. At the top level of a file, the scope is private
to that file. So, `$who` below would not be accessible in another
file.

    $who = "World"
    say("Hello, $who!")

However, all files belong to a public [context](../Scopes.md#context).
The context is specified by a [`package`](../Keywords.md#package)
declaration. When omitted, `package main` is presumed.

To expose `$who` to other files, we'll add both to `package Greeting`
and [`share`](../Keywords.md#share) the variable.

vars.frt

    package Greeting

    share $who = "World"

main.frt

    package Greeting

    share $who
    say("Hello, $who!")
