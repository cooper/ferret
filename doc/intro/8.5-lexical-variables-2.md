# Lexical variables continued

Usually, if a lexical variable exists in an outer scope
and you assign to it, the value is overwritten:

    $something = "I'm giving up on you"

    func saySomething {
        $something = "Another message"
        say($something)
    }

    # Right now, $something is still the original value
    say($something)     # "I'm giving up on you"

    # But now it's "Another message." Even out here.
    saySomething()      # "Another message"
    say($something)     # "Another message"

However, if you explicitly re-initialize the variable with
[`var`](../Keywords.md#var), it becomes local to the
innermost scope.

    $something = "I'm giving up on you"

    func saySomething {
        var $something = "Another message"
        say($something)    
    }

    saySomething()  # Spits out "Another message"
    say($something) # Spits out "I'm giving up on you"

`var` is only ever required in these cases. Any other time,
the first assignment of a new lexical variable has the same effect
as declaring it explicitly with `var`.
