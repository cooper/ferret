# Type interfaces

Earlier I showed you a seemingly pointless example of an object
turned string turned number, but there was actually significance to that.
I was trying to make the point that all values in Ferret are really just
objects and nothing more. 

Because of this, it's a little difficult at times to like look at something
and say with  certainty, "this is a blah." Because it very well may be a
blah, but it could also be a bleh or a meh at the same time.

Instead of checking whether the type of an object is equal to
some specific class, the Ferret way is to think of everything as
just an object and instead concern ourselves with whether it
can perform the roles we need it to.
