# If

You've already seen some `if` statements in other examples, but
here are the details.

In Ferret, all values evaluate true in boolean context besides
`false`, `undefined`, and
[return objects](../Functions.md#return-objects) with no properties.

    $x = 0

    if $x
        say("This will be said. Zero is true.")
    
    if $x != 0
        say("This will not. Do this when you want to test for zero.")

    if [1, 2, 3].empty
        say("This will not be said. Most data types have an empty property.")

    if "".empty
        say("This will. The string is empty.")

Note how, like `for`, in the above examples braces can be omitted if only
a single statement occurs in the `if` body. The one-liner colon syntax
is also permitted.

    if false: say("What has the world come to?")
