# Objects

All values in Ferret are objects. But what does that
actually mean? All values can have **properties**.

    3.odd           # true
    16.sqrt         # 4
    "hi".length     # 2
    (1+2i).abs      # 2.23607

An **object** is the simplest data type of all in Ferret, and all other values 
inherit from it. A plain object is constructed like so.

    $o = (propName: "value", other: 11)

Only bareword keys called *properties* are allowed for objects, but the
corresponding values can be any type.

The properties `propName` and `other` defined above are accessed using property
notation. They can be assigned to this way as well.

    say($o.propName)
    $o.other = "I changed the type from Num to Str"
    $o.newOne = "You can also define new properties this way"
    $o.nonexistent  # accessing nonexistent properties produces no error

The empty object looks like this and has no properties.
